# Dcoder-community-blocks

An open source program to contribute to Dcoder blocks, now anyone and everyone can take part in this open source revolution to help coding community by building blocks for Dcoder's low code editor.

## Block

A block is a piece of code which can be described as an action, for example: Sending a message on Slack, Adding a row in Google sheets, deploying a website on netlify or fetching data from mongodb abstracted with its title, description, inputs, parameters and output.

## Flow

Dcoder is a mobile first low code editor, you can connect the dcoder blocks together to build flows, automations and Dashboards with ui widgets.
